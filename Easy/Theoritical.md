|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition      | A list is an ordered, mutable collection of elements. | A tuple is an ordered, immutable collection of elements.  | A set is an unordered collection of unique elements.  | A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.       |
| Syntax          | Syntax includes square brackets [ , ] with ‘,’ separated data. | Syntax includes curved brackets ( , ) with ‘,’ separated data. | Syntax includes curly brackets { , } with ‘,’ separated data. | Syntax includes curly brackets { , } with ‘,’ separated key-value data. |
| Creation        | A list can be created using the list() function or simple assignment to []. | Tuple can be created using the tuple() function.           | A set dictionary can be created using the set() function. | A dictionary can be created using the dict() function.            |
| Empty Data Structure | An empty list can be created by l = [].               | An empty tuple can be created by t = ().                    | An empty set can be created by s = set().               | An empty dictionary can be created by {}.                         |
| Order           | It is an ordered collection of data.                  | It is also an ordered collection of data.                  | It is an unordered collection of data.                 | Ordered collection in Python version 3.7, unordered in Python Version=3.6. |
| Duplicate Data  | Duplicate data entry is allowed in a List.            | Duplicate data entry is allowed in a Tuple.                | All elements are unique in a Set.                      | Keys are unique, but two different keys CAN have the same value.    |
| Indexing        | Has integer based indexing that starts from ‘0’.      | Also has integer based indexing that starts from ‘0’.      | Does NOT have an index based mechanism.                | Has a Key based indexing i.e. keys identify the value.             |
| Addition        | New items can be added using the append() method.     | Being immutable, new data cannot be added to it.           | The add() method adds an element to a set.             | update() method updates specific key-value pair.                   |
| Deletion        | Pop() method allows deleting an element.              | Being immutable, no data can be popped/deleted.            | Elements can be randomly deleted using pop().          | pop(key) removes specified key along with its value.                |
| Sorting         | sort() method sorts the elements.                      | Immutable, so sorting method is not applicable.           | Unordered, so sorting is not advised.                 | Keys are sorted by using the sorted() method.                      |
| Search          | index() returns index of first occurrence.             | index() returns index of first occurrence.                 | Unordered, so searching is not applicable.             | get(key) returns value against specified key.                      |
| Reversing       | reverse() method reverses the list.                   | Immutable, so reverse method is not applicable.           | Unordered, so reverse is not advised.                 | No integer-based indexing, so no reversal.                         |
| Count           | count() method returns occurrence count.              | count() method returns occurrence count.                  | count() not defined for sets.                         | count() not defined for dictionaries.                             |

6. **What is the purpose of the 'pass' statement in Python?**
   - The 'pass' statement in Python is a null operation that does nothing when executed. It is often used as a placeholder in situations where code is required syntactically but no action is needed.

7. **How do you create a function in Python?**
   - In Python, a function is defined using the 'def' keyword followed by the function name and parameters. The function body is indented and contains the code to be executed when the function is called.

8. **What is the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python?**
   - Mutable data types in Python can be modified after creation, while immutable data types cannot be changed. Examples of mutable types include lists and dictionaries, while examples of immutable types are tuples and strings.

9. **Explain the concept of indentation in Python.**
   - Indentation in Python is used to define the structure of the code. It is crucial for indicating blocks of code within functions, loops, and conditional statements. Consistent indentation is a key aspect of Python syntax.

10. **What is the purpose of the 'import' statement in Python?**
    - The 'import' statement in Python is used to bring external modules or packages into the current script, allowing access to their functions and variables. It enables code reuse and modularity in Python programs.

11. **How do you handle exceptions in Python?**
    - Exceptions in Python are managed using 'try', 'except', and 'finally' blocks. Code that may raise an exception is placed within the 'try' block, and specific error handling logic is defined in the 'except' block.

12. **What is the difference between 'append' and 'extend' methods in Python lists?**
    - The 'append' method in Python lists adds a single element to the end of the list, while the 'extend' method appends multiple elements (such as another list) to the existing list. 'append' modifies the list in place, while 'extend' combines lists.

13. **How do you create a dictionary in Python?**
    - A dictionary in Python is created using curly braces {} and key-value pairs separated by colons. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type. Dictionaries provide efficient data retrieval based on keys.

14. **What is the purpose of the 'range' function in Python?**
    - The 'range' function in Python generates a sequence of numbers within a specified range. It is commonly used in loops to iterate over a sequence of numbers or to create lists of numbers based on a start, stop, and step value.

15. **How do you create a for loop in Python?**
    - A for loop in Python iterates over a sequence of elements such as a list, tuple, or string. It is defined using the 'for' keyword followed by a variable that represents each element in the sequence. The loop body is indented and executed for each iteration.

16. **What is the difference between 'break' and 'continue' statements in Python loops?**
    - The 'break' statement in Python terminates the current loop and exits to the next statement outside the loop, while the 'continue' statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.

17. **How do you create a while loop in Python?**
    - A while loop in Python executes a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. It is defined using the 'while' keyword followed by the condition to be evaluated. The loop body is indented and continues to execute until the condition becomes false.

18. **What is the purpose of the 'return' statement in functions?**
    - The 'return' statement in Python functions is used to exit the function and return a value to the caller. It can also be used to return multiple values as a tuple. Functions without a return statement implicitly return 'None'.

19. **How do you create a string in Python?**
    - Strings in Python are created by enclosing text within single ('') or double ("") quotes. They can also be created using triple quotes (''' ''' or """ """) for multi-line strings. Strings are immutable sequences of characters in Python.

20. **What is the purpose of the 'len' function in Python?**
    - The 'len' function in Python is used to determine the length of a sequence such as a string, list, tuple, or dictionary. It returns the number of elements in the sequence, allowing for dynamic sizing and indexing operations.
